# Where to Eat - St Paul
By Oscar and Jonah

## Project Description
We plan to make a GUI that will provide a restaurant recommendation according to the user's preferences of price, cuisine, and location. For this project, we created the list of data, but if we were to publish our work, we would use a public API and pay for more data.

## Project inspiration
It's a service that we would use, and we wanted to work on data processing skills.

## Deliverables and due dates
1. Create dataset - complete in class 4/10
2. Sketch GUI - complete in class 4/10
3. Sketch UML - complete by 4/12
4. Create front end of GUI - complete by 4/15
