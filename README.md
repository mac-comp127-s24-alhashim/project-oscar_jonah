# Where to Eat - Twin Cities
By Oscar Reza Bautista and Jonah Zimmer

## Description
We plan to make a GUI that will provide a restaurant recommendation according to the user's preferences of price, cuisine, and location. For this project, we created the list of data, but if we were to publish our work, we would use a public API and pay for more data. We decided to do this for our final project, because it's a service that we would use, and we wanted to work on data processing skills.
